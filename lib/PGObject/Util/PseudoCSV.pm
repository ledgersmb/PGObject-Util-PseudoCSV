=head1 NAME

PGObject::Util::PseudoCSV - Tuple/Array parsing and serialization for PGObject

=head1 VERSION

Version 2

=cut

our $VERSION = 2.000000;


=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is a parser and constructor for PostgreSQL text representations of tuples
and arrays.

To parse:

For a tuple, we'd typically:

   my @list = pseudocsv_parse($text_representation);

We can then arrange the hash as:

   my $hashref = pseudocsv_to_hash(\@list, \@col_list);

Which we can combine as:

   my $hashref =  pseudocsv_to_hash(
                     pseudocsv_parse($text_representation),
                     \@col_list
   );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PostgreSQL can represent tuples and arrays in a text format that is almost like
CSV.  Unfortunately this format has a number of gotchas which render existing 
CSV-parsers useless.  This module provides basic parsing functions to other
programs for db interface purposes.  With this module you can both parse 
pseudocsv representations of tuples and arrays and you can create them from a 
list.

The API's here assume you send one (and only one) pseudo-csv record to the API 
at once.  These may be nested, so a single tuple can contain arrays of tuples 
which can contain arrays of tuples ad infinitum but the parsing only goes one
layer deep tuple-wise so that handling classes have an opportunity to re-parse
with appropriate type information. Naturally this has performance implications,
so depth in SQL structures passed should be reasonably limited.

As of 2.0, we no longer automatically call deserialization functions from the
parser itself.  At his point the calling classes MUST call the deserializer
themselves but this is far easier since this has been moved to a separate
service in PGObject 2.0.  This avoids an unecessary dependency on PGObject
and ensures that the module is more generally useful.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 pseudocsv_parse

This does a one-level deep parse of the pseudo-csv, with additional levels in
arrays.  When a tuple is encountered it is instantiated as its type but a 
subarray is parsed for more entities.

Only one pseudocsv record can be passed in at once, but embedded newlines are properly handled.

=cut

sub pseudocsv_parse {
    my ($csv, $type, $registry) = @_;
    if ($csv =~ /^\(/ ) { # tuple
       $csv =~ s/^\((.*)\)$/$1/s;
    } elsif ($csv =~ /^\{/ ) { # array 
       $csv =~ s/^\{(.*)\}$/$1/s;
    }
    $registry ||= 'default';
    my @returnlist = ();
    while (length($csv)) {
        my $val = _parse(\$csv);
        my $in_type = $type;
        $in_type = shift @$type if ref $type eq ref [];
        $val =~ s/""/"/g if defined $val;
        push @returnlist, $val;
    }
    return @returnlist if wantarray;
    return \@returnlist;
}

=head2 pcsv2hash($literal_string, @cols);

Returns a hash from a tuple literal or array literal.  

=cut

sub pcsv2hash {
    my $string = shift;
    $string = shift if $string eq __PACKAGE__;
    my @colnames = @_;

    my @colvals = pseudocsv_parse($string, undef, undef);
    
    my $hash = { map{ $_ => shift @colvals } @colnames };
    return %$hash if wantarray;
    return $hash;
}

=head2 hash2pcsv($hashref, @cols)

Takes an ordered list of columns and a hashref and returns a tuple literal

=cut

sub hash2pcsv {
    my ($hashref, @cols) = @_;
    return to_pseudocsv([map { $hashref->{$_} } @cols], 1)
}


# _parse is the private method which does the hard work of parsing.

sub _parse {
    my ($csvref) = @_;
    my $retval;
    if ($$csvref =~ /^"/){ # quoted string
       $$csvref =~ s/^"(([^"]|"")*)",?//s;
       $retval = $1;
       $retval =~ s/""/"/g;
    } else {
       $$csvref =~ s/^([^,]*)(,|$)//s;
       $retval = $1;
       $retval = undef if $retval =~ /^null$/i;
    }
    if (defined $retval and $retval =~ s/^\{(.*)\}$/$1/){
        my $listref = [];
        push @$listref, _parse(\$retval) while $retval;
        $retval = $listref;
    }
    return $retval;
}

=head2 pseudocsv_tohash($coldata, $colnames) DEPRECATED

Takes an arrayref of column data and an arrayref of column names and returns 
a hash.  This is mostly a helper function designed to help with tuple types.

This interface is deprecated and will go away in 2.0.  Use pcsv2hash instead.

=cut

sub pseudocsv_tohash {
    my ($cols, $colnames) = @_;
    my $hash = { map{ $_ => shift @$cols } @$colnames };
    return %$hash if wantarray;
    return $hash;
}

=head2 to_pseudocsv($datalist, $is_tuple)

Takes a list of data and an is_tuple argument and creates a pseudocsv.

Note:  this does not check for array sanity.  If you are not careful you can
get arrays returned which are not valid SQL arrays.  Remember that SQL arrays
have every item being the same size, and all SQL arrays are are regular in 
size (so all 1 and 2d arrays follow the same form as mathematical matrices).

=cut

sub _val {
    my ($val, $is_tuple) = @_;
    return 'NULL' unless defined $val;

    $val = $val->to_db if eval { $val->can('to_db') };
    $val = to_pseudocsv($_, 0) if ref $_ eq ref [];
    return $val if ref $_ eq ref [] and !$is_tuple;

    $val =~ s/"/""/;
    $val = qq("$val") if $val =~ /(^null$|[",{}])/i;
    return $val;
}

sub to_pseudocsv {
    my ($list, $is_tuple) = @_;
    Carp::croak 'First arg must be an arrayref' unless ref $list;
    my $csv =  join(',', map { _val($_, $is_tuple) } @$list);
    return qq|($csv)| if $is_tuple;	
    return qq|{$csv}|;
}
